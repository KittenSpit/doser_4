Wiring notes for DRV8871

Each pump uses two GPIOs: IN1, IN2 (set in main.cpp arrays).

Forward: PWM on IN1, IN2 = 0 (internally handled by setDrive_).

Reverse (purge): PWM on IN2, IN1 = 0.

Coast stop: both 0. Brake: both PWM (rarely needed here).

What changed vs previous version

Pump driver supports true forward/reverse with DRV8871.

Two LEDC channels per pump, so PWM works in both directions.

Web UI moved to LittleFS (/data/index.html), served statically; APIs unchanged.

Everything else (logger, JSON/CSV, settings in NVS, OLED, scheduler) stays integrated.

If you want me to add mDNS (http://doser.local) or OTA, I can slot those in neatly next.
